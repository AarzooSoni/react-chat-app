# Chat Application Frontend

## Project Overview

This project is a frontend for a chat application built with React. It features a sidebar for conversations, a message view for the selected conversation, and the ability to start new conversations. The application uses Redux for state management, and `redux-persist` ensures that the chat data remains intact after a refresh.

## Features

- **Search**: Filter conversations by contact name.
- **Create Conversation**: Start new conversations with contacts.
- **Message View**: View and send messages in the selected conversation.
- **Persistent Data**: Redux data persists after page refresh.
